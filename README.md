# CSC-344_Networks_Programming_Project
[Python] A fun Python program that simulates CHORD peer-to-peer protocol. Originally created for CSC-344: Computer Networks with Dr. Hyunbum Kim.

# Project Overview/How to Run

This program can just be opened up in IDLE and ran from there. The program takes care of everything itself, and will
tell you all of the information it randomly generates. There are some commented out print statements that if you 
uncomment them will show you some of the raw variables' values, should you wish to walk through the code.

If there are any issues with getting it to run, please let me know by emailing me @ ams1347@uncw.edu.
It works perfect on my computer through thorough testing.

"sampleOutput.txt" is just an example of the output of the program, copied and pasted from the output window.
Figured I'd include it just in case it helps.
